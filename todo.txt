DONE THIS CHECKIN:
Brand new test infrastructure. Ditching CPPUTest, which doesn't suck, but I wanted my own build to support 32-bit linux and 64-bit windows, and to drop reliance on an external package.

TODO:
P1 doxygen
P1 finish README install desc
P1 _MSC_VER -> _WIN32 or whatever?
P1 early out for detected encoding swag
P1 additional int-like args that could be is-integral_v templates
P1 c++ extractor for int types that aren't int
P2 Improved error state transitions
P2 vcpkg
P2 string sizes should be size_t?
P1-2 linting
P2 more erroneous humon tests
P2 UTF8 digits for addressing
P2 consider sorting dict keys and doing BSP search.
P2 allow user to spec index type (int32, int64, etc)
P2 custom memory allocator fns
P2 insertion ops
