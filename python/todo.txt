Done:
Made node iterable. [ch for ch in node] yields the node's children.
Made node a map and a sequence, to allow for len(node), and node[childIdx].
Added caveperson debugging #define for resource debugging.
Added node.key, node.value
Sidestepped a few bugs in Python 3.7.5 related to "s#" parsing.
Made objectify a node method to allow for subtreeing.

Doing:
PyDoc strings with foo => bar type text.
Use python memory management
Trove_findNodesByCommentContaining and others aren't using kwargs
Do basic test suite hitting all function points
Version in setup.py from include/humon/version.h
[] accessors on nodes
.value for nodes (return the string)
